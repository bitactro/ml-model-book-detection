# ML Model â€” Book Detection

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning-based **binary image classifier** that identifies whether a given image contains a **book** or **not**. It is built for automation scenarios such as:

* ðŸ“š Document scanning workflows
* ðŸ§¾ Knowledge-base indexing
* ðŸ—‚ Content moderation and categorization

The project leverages **Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)** for high performance on small datasets, making it lightweight and deployable on both **servers and edge devices**.

## Key Features

| Capability                        | Description                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| âœ… Book vs Non-Book Classification | Outputs `True` / `False` for image inputs            |
| âœ… Optimized Inference             | Achieves ~50ms prediction time on CPU                |
| âœ… Command-line Prediction         | Simple script `predict_book.py` for batch inference  |
| âœ… Modular Training                | Easily retrain with new dataset via `train_model.py` |
| âœ… Clean Architecture              | Separated logic for Dataset, Training, and Inference |

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/bitactro/ml-model-book-detection.git
cd ml-model-book-detection

# 2. Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running Inference

```bash
python predict_book.py
```

**Example Output:**

```
b1.jpeg -> isBookDetected: True
b2.jpeg -> isBookDetected: True
nb1.jpg -> isBookDetected: False
nb2.jpg -> isBookDetected: False
```

## Model Architecture

| Component           | Details                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Base Model          | MobileNetV2 (pretrained on ImageNet)     |
| Classification Head | GlobalAveragePooling + Dense(1, Sigmoid) |
| Loss Function       | Binary Crossentropy                      |
| Optimizer           | Adam (LR Scheduling Enabled)             |

---

## Training Notes

* **Data Augmentation:** Random flips, rotations, and scaling applied to improve generalization.
* **Transfer Learning:** Base model frozen initially; classification head trained first, then fine-tuned.
* **Batch Size & Epochs:** Configurable in `train_model.py`.
* **Validation Split:** Recommended 80/20 train/validation.

---

## Future Roadmap

* [ ] Convert to **ONNX / TensorRT** for optimized deployment
* [ ] Add **confidence thresholding** for probabilistic output
* [ ] Expand dataset for **multi-class book detection** (e.g., cover, open book, spine)
* [ ] Add visual output with bounding boxes or highlighted regions
